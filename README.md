# Logo Creator App


For this week's activity, we had the opportunity to utilize our new knowledge of back-end web development to demonstrate the use of a command-line app which will allow the user to generate a stylized logo based upon pre-entered criteria. We will be building off of the experience gained from the previous challenge, the README Generator App, in order to accomplish this, as well as incorporating a testing suite "Jest" within our DevDependencies. We will also be utilizing the Inquirer once again for prompts and user entry.

A walkthrough video will also be provided for further demonstration once the application has been completed.
